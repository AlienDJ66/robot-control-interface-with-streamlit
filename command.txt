streamlit run app.py

cd /home/jovyan/work
streamlit run app.py --server.headless true --server.port 8501

cd /home/jovyan/work
pip install pybullet streamlit numpy pillow

here is the command to start ui, run in jupyter desktop terminal,under work folder
streamlit run app.py --server.headless true
note: since I created a new file with different name just replace app.py with the file name you want to run


process: in windows
1. run the docker container the professor gives using this command in powershell:

correct one:
docker run -d -p 8888:8888 -p 8501:8501 -v C:\cstu\robotic-class-docker-env\workfolder:/home/jovyan/work --name my_jupyter_ros2 intel4coro/jupyter-ros2:jazzy-py3.12 jupyter lab --NotebookApp.token=''            

if you are using docker desktop, next time just goto the desktop and start this container, no need to run the command

note C:\cstu\robotic-class-docker-env\workfolder is the path in your own computer so change it to the actual path, any code file will go in this folder and it will show up in jupyter lab

Explanation:

-p 8888:8888 → Jupyter Lab port

-p 8501:8501 → Streamlit port

-v ... → map your local folder into the container

--name robot_env → container name, so it persists after closing

Note: Remove the --rm flag if you want the container to persist between restarts.

2. now go to 8888 in localhost, it will have jupyter lab
put the app.py file in the folder
3. go to the desktop, 
Open a terminal in Jupyter Lab desktop (or Jupyter notebook cell):

pip install streamlit pybullet numpy


streamlit → GUI for controlling robot

pybullet → physics simulation

numpy → numerical computations

Installing in the container ensures packages are available inside the container, not on your Windows host.
4. Place your app.py in the mapped folder

Make sure app.py is under your mapped folder, e.g.:

C:\cstu\robotic-class-docker-env\workfolder\app.py


Inside the container, this appears as /home/jovyan/work/app.py.

This ensures both Jupyter and Streamlit can access the same file.
5. Run the Streamlit app

Open a terminal in the container (desktop) and run:

streamlit run /home/jovyan/work/app.py --server.headless true --server.port 8501


Opens Streamlit inside the container.

If using the Docker mapped port, access via your browser:

http://localhost:8501


You should see target X/Y/Z inputs and “Go to Position” button.

6. PyBullet simulation

PyBullet GUI will automatically open inside the container desktop.

The robot arm will move smoothly toward the target when clicking Go to Position.

A small sphere shows the target location.

If the target is unreachable, a warning appears in Streamlit, and the robot does not move.
